# Weather Data Visualization
Cool simple graphs-- Using the National Weather Service API is the star of this show.
Currently using using an application of of this to be able to have real life weather accuracy being simulated in game.

Had the struggle of switching to a different city, until my Professor clarified how it's changed.

# Morse Code Converter
Cute looking code converter that is reverse compatible!

I had more confidence in changing the CSS this time around, but struggled with the creativity.
While trying to follow tutorials, I wasn't able to get the results I needed due to different base code.
Overwhelemd, I did turn to ChatGPT for help with text box changing.

# Project II - Numbers are Scary, but I am Proud
My pride & joy! An interactive website that features data given by the Animation Guild on job disruption due to the rise of AI.
It consists of an interactive USA map where you can hover over states for more information & toggle between data sets for different information.

I struggled a lot with this one. I think I was overly ambitious & didn't end up with the result in my head. I learned a lot from this project with all the failing.

HOWEVER! I am ever still so proud of what I was able to make. I did get lots of help from my partner who's a programmer himself. We had lots of fun as I was able to understand more & follow what he speaks about for programming than before! I did also reuse techniques from morse code converter & the weather data visualization by playing around with API-- but wasn't able to successfully apply it all. Turned it around using a combination of Leaflet tutorials & help from my partner for setting up the interactive part. ChatGPT was used to adjust CSS colours, with prompt -- "Modern boxes with each state having it's own unique colour when different dataset selected."

OG Code: Leaflet Open Source Javascript Library.
